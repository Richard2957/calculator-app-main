### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Built with

Vanilla CSS and Javascript.

### What I learned

It was hard to get the color scheme right at first because the instructions were unclear.

After what seemed like ages getting the layout and colors right, adding the JS for the actual calculator, and thinking through the logic of how calculators work, was the most fun.
